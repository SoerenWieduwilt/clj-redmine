* clj-redmine

A Clojure client to access the REST-API of Redmine.

** Motivation

It just seemed easier to write this from scratch in Clojure than to
adapt the existing Java-library (see Links below) and rely on that.
Other than that it was fun and is a nice project for Sören and
Johannes.  :-)

** Usage

FIXME: write
